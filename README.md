# üèÜ Customer Rewards API

A Spring Boot REST API that calculates monthly and total reward points for customers based on their purchase transactions.

##  Reward Calculation Rules

For each transaction:
-  2 points for every dollar spent **over $100**
-  1 point for every dollar spent **between $50 and $100**

### Example:
A transaction of **$120** earns:
- 2 x ($120 - $100) = 40 points
- 1 x ($100 - $50) = 50 points  
**Total: 90 points**
